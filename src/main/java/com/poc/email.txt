Subject: Urgent Analysis Required: BACS Payment Flow Issue & Duplicate Records Post SEPA-CT BIV Deployment

Dear [Recipient's Name/Team],

I hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to report a critical issue that emerged following the SEPA-CT BIV deployment on March 18, 2024, which has severely impacted our BACS payment flow. This email aims to succinctly outline the observed problem and our initial findings for your expert analysis.

**Issue Overview:**
- **Event:** Post SEPA-CT BIV deployment on March 18, 2024.
- **Main Issue:** BACS payment flow has ceased functioning.
- **Error Detected:** A DB4C error with the message "multiple customers account found."

**Specific Observation:**
Upon investigating the prod customer setup table, we noted a critical anomaly for customer ID 17025. Specifically, there are now two records associated with this ID post-deployment. Our analysis suggests that an additional record was inadvertently added during the deployment process, which was not present beforehand.

**Request for Immediate Action:**
- **Analysis Request:** We urgently require your expertise to investigate how the deployment may have led to the insertion of an additional record for customer ID 17025, causing the DB4C error and the consequent disruption of our BACS payment flow.
- **Focus Areas:** Please focus on the deployment changes affecting the customer setup process and database integrity, especially concerning the handling of customer IDs.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Diagnosis:** A thorough examination of the deployment procedures and database operations conducted on March 18, 2024, is needed to pinpoint the cause of the duplicate record creation.
2. **Resolution Plan:** Based on your analysis, we seek recommendations for rectifying the current issue and preventing such occurrences in the future.

Given the significant operational impact of this issue, we appreciate your prompt attention and detailed analysis to resolve this matter effectively. Please let us know your availability for a meeting to discuss this further and to coordinate our next steps.

Thank you for your immediate attention and support in addressing this urgent issue.
